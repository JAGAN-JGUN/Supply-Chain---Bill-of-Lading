# Supply Chain - Bill of Lading (Blockchain-Based)

This project is a full-stack blockchain-based solution for securing and tracking **Bills of Lading** in a **Supply Chain** using **IoT**, **Ethereum Smart Contracts**, and a **Flutter Mobile App** interface.

---

## Overview

The Bill of Lading is a crucial legal document in the supply chain, often prone to fraud or loss. This system ensures secure, traceable, and real-time validation of goods using:

- Blockchain (Ethereum) for decentralized, tamper-proof records.
- Flutter frontend for intuitive user interaction.
- Python backend for contract interaction and data handling.
- IoT integration via Arduino to collect sensor data in real time.

---

## Why This Project

The maritime and logistics industries still heavily depend on physical documents like the **Bill of Lading (BoL)**, which are vulnerable to loss, delays, fraud, and manipulation. There is also:

- A lack of transparency among exporters, importers, banks, customs authorities, etc.
- Little to no accountability for delays or thefts.
- Paper-based inefficiencies and environmental concerns.

This project digitizes and decentralizes the BoL using blockchain to offer:

- Tamper-proof, immutable records.
- A decentralized ledger accessible by all stakeholders.
- A digital transformation toward paperless operations.

## How the System Works

</div>

### System Components:
1. **IoT Module (Arduino):** Gathers sensor data (e.g., temperature).
2. **Python Backend Server:** Middleware between frontend and blockchain.
3. **Ethereum Blockchain (Private):** Stores shipment and BoL data.
4. **Flutter App:** Interface for shipper and receiver to interact with data.

### End-to-End Flow:

1. **Order Placement**
   - User inputs Order ID and Shipper ID through the Flutter app.
   - Data is transmitted to the backend and appended to the smart contract.

2. **Smart Contract Interaction**
   - The smart contract stores transaction data, payment status, and BoL info.
   - Data is immutable and transparently accessible.

3. **IoT Integration**
   - Arduino collects live shipment data (optional).
   - Can be sent to backend and integrated into smart contract if needed.

4. **Frontend Interaction**
   - Users (e.g., receivers) view BoL, status, and shipment details in the app.
   - Data fetched from blockchain via web3dart library.
